🚫 How to Be a Person Who Fails (Guaranteed Ways to Stay Stuck):

Never Start Anything

Keep planning, keep dreaming, but never take the first step.

Wait until “perfect conditions” come (they never will).

Quit at the First Obstacle

Face one rejection, lose one hackathon, get one low grade → decide “I’m not made for this.”

Winners keep going; failures stop here.

Fear What Others Think

Let laughter, criticism, or “log kya kahenge” control your choices.

Adjust your dream to match their small expectations.

Work Hard, But Without Direction

Effort without strategy = wasted energy.

Failures often burn out by doing 100x effort without 1x planning.

Never Build a Team or Network

Try to “do everything alone.”

Ignore mentors, friends, collaborators. Lone wolves usually stay small.

Blame, Don’t Learn

If something fails, blame parents, teachers, teammates, government, luck… anyone but yourself.

True growth comes from asking: What can I improve?

Avoid Risk, Stay Safe

Choose the comfortable option every time.

Safety feels nice but kills greatness.
